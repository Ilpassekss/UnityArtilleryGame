# Unity Artillery Defense Game

This is a simple artillery defense game made in Unity.

## Gameplay

You control a artillery unit and must defend yourself from waves of incoming tanks. Tanks approach from multiple directions and must be destroyed before they reach the firing radius.

- Tanks are destroyed in 1–2 shots.
- You have a **3-second reload time** between shots.
- If a tank reaches your artillery and is within firing radius, after a short delay it fires — and **you take a damage**. If you lose all your HP, you **lose the game**.
